| 30-12-2025 |  2.5  | Project initialization. Setting up Azure for Students account and function app instance. Installing Azure Functions Core Tools. Test "hello world" endpoint.                                                                                                                                                    | Set up proper GitHub Actions to host a demo endpoint for testing.                           |
| 31-12-2025 |   3   | Finished workflows for Azure Functions deployment. Set up Web App in Azure Portal for frontend. Setup workflows for frontend. Battled with website visibility issues, found out it was related to start up command in Azure, solved those.                                                                      | Tomorrow start working on authentication. I'm thinking easy auth for now, but not sure yet. |
| 25-01-2025 |   3   | Decided to start working on the frontend instead of figuring out auth before I have some components ready. Added basic nav menu components and hamburger menu + header collapsing for smaller screens, so it's a bit more responsive. Fixed / try fixing credential issue on Azure side after repo name change. | Next probably work on the main content component.                                           |
